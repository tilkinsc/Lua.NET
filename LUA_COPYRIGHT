                                  Lua License

   Lua  is  free  software:  it  can  be  used for any purpose, including
   commercial   purposes,   at  absolutely  no  cost.  No  paperwork,  no
   royalties,  no GNU-like "copyleft" restrictions, either. Just download
   it and use it. Lua is certified Open Source software. Its licenses are
   compatible with GPL. Lua is not in the public domain and PUC-Rio keeps
   its copyright. The legal details are below.

   [osi certified]   License for Lua 5.0 and later versions:
   Since Lua 5.0, Lua is licensed under the terms of the MIT license
   reproduced below.

   [open source]   License for Lua 4.0 and earlier versions:
   Until  Lua  4.0, Lua used its own license, which was very close to the
   zlib license and others, but not quite the same.

   The  spirit  of  both licenses is that you are free to use Lua for any
   purpose  at  no cost without having to ask us. The only requirement is
   that  if  you  do use Lua, then you should give us credit by including
   the  appropriate  copyright  notice  somewhere  in your product or its
   documentation.  A nice, but optional, way to give us further credit is
   to  include  a  Lua logo and a link to our site in a web page for your
   product.

   The  Lua language is entirely designed, implemented, and maintained by
   a  team  at  PUC-Rio in Brazil. The implementation is not derived from
   licensed software.
