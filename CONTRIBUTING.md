## How to Contribute

1. Follow the code style
```C#
if ()
{
	
}

try
{
	
}
catch (...)
{
	
}

if ()
	return;

for (int i = 0; i<=1; i++)
{
	
}

while (...)
{
	
}

private int _name;
public int Name;
public int Name { get; private set; }

public void Example(int argName)
{
	
}
```

2. Push changes to a new local branch to the 'dev' branch. ('contributor-feature' -> 'dev')
3. You are encouraged to start a PR early so we can spy on what you are working on!
4. Versions should not be bumped at all
5. gitignore is free game add anything that fits
6. Do not use #region
