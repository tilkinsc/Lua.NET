## How to Contribute

1. Follow the code style
```C#
if ()
{
	
}

try
{
	
}
catch (...)
{
	
}

if ()
	return;

for (int i = 0; i<=1; i++)
{
	
}

while (...)
{
	
}

private int _name;
public int Name;
public int Name { get; private set; }

public void Example(int argName)
{
	
}
```

2. Push changes to a new local branch to the 'dev' branch. ('contributor-feature' -> 'dev')
3. You are encouraged to start a PR early so we can spy on what you are working on!
4. Versions should not be bumped at all
5. gitignore is free game add anything that fits
